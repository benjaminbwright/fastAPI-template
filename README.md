# FastAPI Project Template

A modern, production-ready template for building APIs with Python 3.8+ using FastAPI. This template provides a modular structure and includes a TODO list CRUD example to demonstrate best practices.

## Features

- 🚀 FastAPI for high-performance API development
- 📁 Modular project structure
- 🔍 Example TODO list CRUD implementation
- 📝 Auto-generated API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- ✨ Clean, maintainable architecture
- 🔒 Type safety with Pydantic models

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Setup

1. Clone the template:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fastapi-template.git
   cd fastapi-template
   ```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:

   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv venv

   # Windows
   .\venv\Scripts\activate

   # macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

5. Open http://localhost:8000/docs to view the API documentation

Can you add todo list crud and modular routing to this project?

I'll help you create a modular FastAPI application with TODO list CRUD operations. We'll need to create several new files and modify the existing one. Here's how we'll structure it:

1. First, let's create a new directory structure for modular routing:
2. Let's create a new file for the TODO models:
   datetime
   Let's create the routes file:
   )
   Let's create an updated requirements.txt:
3. Let's create a README.md with instructions:
   :
   pip install -r requirements.txt## Running the applicationRun the following command:python main.pyThe API will be available at http://localhost:8000## API Endpoints- GET /todos - List all todos- POST /todos - Create a new todo- GET /todos/{todo_id} - Get a specific todo- PUT /todos/{todo_id} - Update a todo- DELETE /todos/{todo_id} - Delete a todo## API DocumentationOnce the server is running, you can access:- Swagger UI documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs- ReDoc documentation at http://localhost:8000/redoc
   This implementation provides:
   A modular structure with separate routes and models
   Full CRUD operations for TODOs
4. Input validation using Pydantic models
   In-memory storage (you can later replace it with a database)
   API documentation (automatically generated by FastAPI)
   To test the API, you can:
   Run the server
   Visit http://localhost:8000/docs to see the Swagger UI
   Try out the different endpoints using the interactive documentation
   The todos are stored in memory, so they will be reset when you restart the server. For a production application, you'd want to add a database, but this setup gives you a good starting point for development and testing.
   This is a template repo for making a FastAPI project in Python with an MIT license. Can you write me a descriptive readme indicating how to use this repo to get started and how submit PR's to contribute?

I'll create a comprehensive README.md file that explains how to use the template and contribute to the project.
:
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fastapi-template.git
cd fastapi-template
:
bash
python -m venv venv
:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
:
bash
python main.py
fastapi-template/
├── main.py # Main application entry point
├── requirements.txt # Project dependencies
├── models/ # Pydantic models
│ └── todo.py # TODO model definitions
└── routes/ # API routes
└── todo_routes.py # TODO route handlers
:
bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
:
bash
git commit -m "Add some feature"
:
bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
)
This README provides:
Clear installation and setup instructions
Project structure overview 3. API endpoint documentation
Detailed contribution guidelines
Development best practices
License and support information
You can customize the repository URLs, usernames, and other specific details before using it. The README is designed to be welcoming to contributors while maintaining clear guidelines for code quality and consistency.
Something went wrong. Can you try writing that readme file again?

I'll write the README file again.

├── models/ # Data models
│ └── todo.py # TODO models
└── routes/ # API routes
└── todo_routes.py # TODO endpoints

This README now provides:
Clear and concise setup instructions
Detailed contribution guidelines
Project structure explanation
API endpoint documentation 5. Development best practices 6. Instructions for getting help
The format is more readable and better organized than the previous version. You can customize the repository URLs and other specific details before using it.
Some of the syntax broke the copy and paste block. Can you regenerate the readme in it's own raw markdown block?

Here's the complete README in a single markdown block:
try again the code block syntax is breaking the changes

Let me try one more time with a simpler approach:
fastapi-template/
├── main.py # Application entry point
├── requirements.txt # Project dependencies
├── models/ # Data models
│ └── todo.py # TODO models
└── routes/ # API routes
└── todo_routes.py # TODO endpoints

## API Endpoints

The template includes a complete TODO list API:

- `GET /todos` - List all todos
- `POST /todos` - Create a todo
- `GET /todos/{id}` - Get a specific todo
- `PUT /todos/{id}` - Update a todo
- `DELETE /todos/{id}` - Delete a todo
